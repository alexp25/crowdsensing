An agent-based model (ABM) is a computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) in order to understand the behavior of a system and what governs its outcomes. It combines elements of game theory, complex systems, emergence, computational sociology, multi-agent systems, and evolutionary programming.

script.py
- simulates solo travelers vs groups (starting all at the same time)
- this is only used for easier understanding

script2.py
- simulates guided tours (multiple larger groups that start at fixed time slots) vs self-guided tours (multiple smaller groups that can start at any time)
- this should be used for accurate simulation of real world scenario
